    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed around a user's learning journey, not the report's linear chapters. It starts with a high-level hook ("What is it?") and then breaks into four thematic, interactive sections: 1. "The Big Idea" visualizes the core benefits (cost, diversification) for immediate impact. 2. "How It Works" uses interactive tabs to compare the key building blocks (Indexes, Fund Types). 3. "The Trade-Offs" presents risks in a balanced, non-alarming way. 4. "How to Start" provides a simple, actionable checklist. This structure prioritizes understanding and engagement over rote memorization, allowing users to explore concepts in a non-linear, digestible format. Navigation is handled by a sticky header, making it easy to jump between these core concepts. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: The staggering difference in returns due to fees ($88,482). Goal: Demonstrate the power of low costs. Viz/Method: Interactive Line Chart (Chart.js) comparing two funds over 30 years. Interaction: The chart is animated on load, visually showing the growing gap. Justification: A static number is forgettable; a visual representation of lost wealth is impactful and a core "wow" factor.
        - Report Info: S&P 500 vs. DJIA vs. NASDAQ. Goal: Compare the major market indexes. Viz/Method: An interactive card-based layout. Interaction: Clicking a tab for an index reveals its detailed information in a clean, focused view. Justification: Replaces a static table with an engaging, user-directed comparison tool that reduces cognitive load.
        - Report Info: Mutual Funds vs. ETFs. Goal: Compare the two fund structures. Viz/Method: A two-column interactive comparison. Interaction: Buttons allow toggling between the two, with key differences highlighted. Justification: Makes the comparison direct and easy to digest side-by-side.
        - Report Info: The concept of diversification. Goal: Show, not just tell, the benefit of spreading risk. Viz/Method: A simple visual diagram made with HTML/Tailwind. A single large block represents a risky single-stock investment, contrasted with a grid of 500 small blocks for an index fund. Justification: This abstract concept becomes concrete and instantly understandable without complex charts.
        - Report Info: The steps to start investing. Goal: Make the process feel achievable. Viz/Method: A styled, step-by-step checklist diagram using HTML/Tailwind. Justification: Turns a text list into a clear, visual roadmap, reducing intimidation.
